# Introduction
The purpose of this repository is to test the vanilla policy or REINFORCE algorithm on different environments and documented the strengths and weaknesses of the algorithm as well as the lessons learned when implementing it. Having embarked on my RL journey, I found that empirical and implementation insights were harder to find. More importantly, research indicated that simple algorithm could outperform more complex and supposedly better algorithms such as PPO because how algorithms were implemented mattered<sup>[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12729), [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05990)</sup>.
